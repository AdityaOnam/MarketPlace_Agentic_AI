# Progress

Living state of the Round 3 build. Updated at the end of every meaningful chunk of work
(see the `project-flow` skill). Newest notes at the top of each list.

**Current phase:** 2 — Architecture and Skill Decomposition.

## Done

- 2026-09-02 — **Phase 1b Synthesis Complete.**
  - `docs/RESEARCH.md` mapped with all 24 signal definitions (13 discoverability, 11 engagement) backed by literature.
  - `docs/research/EVIDENCE-LEDGER.md` populated with the 24 candidate checks, their source mappings, severity rules, and false-positive guards.
  - `docs/EVALS.md` rewritten with the concrete metric targets and procedures derived from `05-evaluation-methodology.md`.
  - `docs/CORPUS.md` rewritten with the stratified sampling frame and split logic derived from `08-web-corpora-and-sampling.md`.
- 2026-09-01 — **Domains 04 and 06 landed**, executed in Antigravity (separate tool,
  separate budget) from the stored briefs — 13 entries each, statuses marked per entry:
  [`papers/04-...`](research/papers/04-web-agents-page-understanding.md) (WebArena,
  Mind2Web, VisualWebArena, WorkArena, BrowserGym, AssistantBench, WebVoyager, AutoWebGLM,
  Trafilatura) and
  [`papers/06-...`](research/papers/06-structured-data-entity-grounding.md) (WDC Oct 2024,
  Web Almanac 2024, MAVE, FEVER, BLINK, ReFinED, PopQA/Mallen, FreshLLMs, TempLAMA).
  These close the two substantive discoverability gaps.
- 2026-09-01 — **Literature review, priority half complete.** Four domain agents landed: 01 (GEO), 05 (Eval), 07 (On-site), 08 (Corpora). Conclusions banked as decisions **D-006** to **D-010**.
- 2026-09-01 — Research scaffolding: `research/README.md`, `research/EVIDENCE-LEDGER.md`, `research/AGENT-BRIEFS.md`, `EVALS.md`, `CORPUS.md`.
- 2026-09-01 — Handout read in full, copied to `round3-handout.pdf`, distilled into the `round3-spec` skill; working method in the `project-flow` skill.

## Next — phased, each phase ends in a checkpointed state

**Phase 2 — architecture.** Fix the skill decomposition and the entrypoint's composition
contract. Blocked on nothing, but running research domains 02 and 03 would strengthen the justification.

**Phase 3 — author the skills.** `SKILL.md` per concern, `references/` for checklists,
`scripts/` for executable checks.

**Phase 4 — corpus + harness.** Build the dev/held-out/negative-control/adversarial sets
and the eval harness per D-010.

**Phase 5 — harden and package.** Guardrail and generalization gates, root `README.md`,
manifest, zip.

## Deferred — the four unrun research domains

Briefs are ready in [`AGENT-BRIEFS.md`](research/AGENT-BRIEFS.md); relaunch is copy-paste.

| Domain | Why it was deferred | What we lose without it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 02 Skill authoring | Phase 3 can proceed on general practice | Weaker evidence base for *how* instructions are written for reliability and determinism |
| 03 Composition | Phase 2 can proceed on judgment | The rubric's composition line becomes an argument from taste, not evidence |

**Honest status of coverage:** both halves of the audit now have a research base — 01/04/06
for discoverability, 07 for engagement, 05 for evaluation, 08 for corpora. The two
remaining domains affect how well we can *justify* design choices (how skills are authored,
and how many there should be), not what the checks are. They are worth running before
Phase 2 if budget allows, but they do not block it.

## Blocked / open questions

- **No public AI-assistant citation dataset exists**, and no curated site-quality label
  corpus — domain 08 searched and found neither. Gold labels must be hand-authored.
- **Corpus access blockers:** HTTP Archive needs a billed Google Cloud project; CrUX needs
  an API key and excludes small sites (exactly our target population); ClueWeb22 is gated;
  Tranco's combined-list licence is unclear. Wayback is unreliable as a fixture source (at
  most ~17.9% of composite mementos are both temporally coherent and complete).
- **Nothing in the literature measures our actual target quantity** — the effect of a
  specific site-side fix on a specific brand's representation in a specific assistant. That
  experiment does not appear to exist publicly. We build on mechanism-level evidence, and
  the report's language must say so.
- **ICC assumption.** Domain 08's sample-size math assumes ρ≈0.20 (unmeasured). ρ > 0.4
  falsifies the split plan.
